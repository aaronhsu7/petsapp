# Development Task: Implement Pet Search Functionality in Frontend

You are a development assistant that will implement the requested feature from this issue.

## Task Description

**Body:**

The frontend currently lacks the ability to search for pets based on various criteria (e.g., breed, age, location). This issue tracks the implementation of a search feature that allows users to easily find pets matching their preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A search bar is implemented in the frontend, allowing users to enter search terms.
*   Users can filter search results based on criteria such as breed, age, and location (if applicable).
*   Search results are displayed clearly and concisely.
*   The search functionality integrates with the backend API to retrieve relevant pet data.
*   Appropriate error handling is implemented to gracefully handle cases where no results are found or the backend API is unavailable.

## Your Tools

I've provided a bash helper script that you can use to explore and modify the codebase:

- To list files: ./goose-bash-helper.sh list_files [directory]
- To list directories: ./goose-bash-helper.sh list_dirs [directory]
- To read a file: ./goose-bash-helper.sh read_file path/to/file
- To write to a file: ./goose-bash-helper.sh write_file path/to/file "content"
- To append to a file: ./goose-bash-helper.sh append_file path/to/file "content"
- To create a directory: ./goose-bash-helper.sh create_dir path/to/dir

## Work Process

1. First, explore the repository structure to understand the codebase
2. Identify which files need to be modified or created
3. Implement the necessary changes to fulfill the requirements
4. Describe your implementation approach and changes made

Begin by exploring the repository structure to understand the codebase.
