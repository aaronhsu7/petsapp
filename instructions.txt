Task: Implement Pet Search Functionality in Frontend

Details: **Body:**

The frontend currently lacks the ability to search for pets based on various criteria (e.g., breed, age, location). This issue tracks the implementation of a search feature that allows users to easily find pets matching their preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A search bar is implemented in the frontend, allowing users to enter search terms.
*   Users can filter search results based on criteria such as breed, age, and location (if applicable).
*   Search results are displayed clearly and concisely.
*   The search functionality integrates with the backend API to retrieve relevant pet data.
*   Appropriate error handling is implemented to gracefully handle cases where no results are found or the backend API is unavailable.

Validation: Test the changes to ensure they work correctly.
